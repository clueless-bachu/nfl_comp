~~1) Calculate relative distance, speed and orientation these values are decently correlated with contact and hence should be used -- DONE~~
~~2) How to get bboxes for frames without that information?lets defualt to interpolation -- DONE~~
~~3) Stratify based on 2 conditions to get multiple sets -- DONE~~
~~4) Get team and position~~
~~5) Use Early stopping~~
~~4) Start with binary cross entropy and find optimizer [use adam by default]~~
~~5) learn about data loaders in pytorch - DONE~~
~~6) Integrate pytorch with tensorboard~~
~~7) Use player details with ground tag~~
~~8) Make the frickin model~~
~~9) split data into train and test with seed~~
~~10) validation step for nth iteration~~
~~11) Set data set to shuffle~~
~~12) reduce LR on plateau~~
~~13) save class with different modes~~
~~14) Add name to models~~
~~15) add training stats for each iteration - acc, mathew, classwise~~
~~16) Split train test based on gameplay~~
~~17) Use Float16~~
~~18) Use AdamW~~
